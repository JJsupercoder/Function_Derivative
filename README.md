# Function_Derivative
Find the derivative of a function using string and re module

Make sure to install numpy and matplotlib libraries (Go to cmd and write - pip install numpy)

Can differentiate:
1. Basic functions(should be present in deridict) and constants
2. Product rule d(uvw...)/dx
3. Chain rule d /dx (f(g(...(x))))
4. f^n(x), where n is an integer (all polynomial functions included)
5. Combinations of 2,3 and 4
6. Quotient rule, but only one times
